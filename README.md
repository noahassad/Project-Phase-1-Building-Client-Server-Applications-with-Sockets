# Project-Phase-1-Building-Client-Server-Applications-with-Sockets
This project was developed as part of an assignment at SAIT.
The base socket structure code was given to us in class examples, but we expanded on it to include additional features such as checking to see if the number being sent by the client was even or odd.
